### C++ Twilio REST SDK

### DESCRIPTION
The Twilio REST SDK simplifies the process of making calls to the Twilio REST.
The Twilio REST API lets you initiate outgoing calls, list previous call,
and much more.  See http://www.twilio.com/docs for more information.

### USAGE
Include TwilioRest.h at the top of your C++ code and put the
TwilioRest.h file in the same directory as your code. As shown in
Examples.cpp, you will need to specify the ACCOUNT_ID and
ACCOUNT_TOKEN given to you by Twilio before you can make REST requests.

### FILES
 * **TwilioRest.cpp**: build and link this library with your code
 * **Examples.cpp**: examples of usage 
 * **Makefile**: makefile to build the library and examples code (requires libcurl)
