### C++ Twilio REST SDK

### DESCRIPTION
The C++ Twilio REST SDK simplifies the process of making requests 
to the Twilio REST API and generating TwiML.
The Twilio REST API lets you initiate outgoing calls, 
send SMS, list previous call, and much more.
See http://www.twilio.com/docs for more information.

### USAGE
Build Twilio lib twilio-cplusplus.a and include it to your project
As shown in Examples.cpp, you will need to specify the ACCOUNT_SID and
ACCOUNT_TOKEN given to you by Twilio before you can make REST requests.

### FILES
 * Rest.cpp: REST wrapper
 * TwiML.cpp: TwiML generation helper
 * Utils.cpp: Utils to validate request signature
 * Examples.cpp: examples of usage 
 * UnitTests.h: unit tests 
 * Makefile: makefile to build the library, examples code and unit tests suite (requires libcurl). Type 'make' to build the library. 'make examples' to build the examples. Type 'make unittests' to build the unit tests suite and run it.
